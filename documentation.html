                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
                    document
                    written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how
                    elements
                    should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to
                    W3C specifications. Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done
                    synchronously, which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about
                    CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version

                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
                    </li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).

                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you
                    need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content
                    display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background
                    images and colors?</p>
                <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet
                    language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects
                    paragraph text, setting the color to red
                </p>
                <p>
                    there are Three mathods of applying CSS to our document, which are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>External CSS</li>
                    <li>Internal CSS</li>
                    <li>Inline CSS</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    External CSS
                </h3>
                <p>
                    An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most
                    common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple
                    web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet
                </p>
                <code>
                    <p><span><</span><span>head</span><span>></span></p>
                <p> <span><</span><span>link</span> <span>rel="stylesheet"</span> <span>href="styles.css"</span><span>></span></p>                    
                <p><span><</span><span>/</span><span>head</span><span>></span></p> 
                </code>

                <p>The Style sheet might look like this:</p>
                <code>
                    h1 {<br>
                        color: blue; <br>
                        background-color: yellow;<br>
                        border: 1px solid black; <br>
                      }
                </code>
                <h3>
                    Internal CSS
                </h3>
                <p>
                    An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place
                    CSS inside a style element contained inside the HTML head.
                </p>
                <p>it might look like this:</p>
                <code>
                    <p><span><</span>html<span>></span></p> 
                    <p><span><</span><span>head</span><span>></span></p>
                    <p><span><</span>style<span>></span></p>
                   h<span>1</span> {<br>
                        color: blue; <br>
                        background-color: yellow; <br>
                        border: 1px solid black;<br>
                      }<br>
                
                      p {<br>
                        color: red;<br>

                    <p><span><</span><span>/</span>body<span>></span> </p>  
                    <p><span><</span><span>/</span> html<span>></span></p> 
                </code>
                <h3>
                    Inline CSS
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style
                    attribute. The implementation of an inline style in an HTML document might look like this:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <p><span><</span>html<span>></span></p> 
                    <p><span><</span><span>head</span><span>></span></p>
                    <p><span><</span><span>/</span><span>head</span><span>></span></p>
                    <p><span><</span>body<span>></span></p>
                    <p><span><</span><span>h1</span> <span>style="color:blue; background-color:yellow; border:1px solid black;"</span><span>></span> I'm styled blue with a black background <span><</span><span>/</span>h1<span>></span></p>
                    <p><span><</span><span>p</span> <span>style="color:red;"</span><span>></span> change my color to red <span><</span><span>/</span><span>p></span></p>
                    <p><span><</span><span>/</span>body<span>></span> </p>  
                    <p><span><</span><span>/</span> html<span>></span></p> 
                </code>
                <p><strong>Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible</strong>. It is the opposite of a best practice.
                    First, it is the
                    least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple
                    edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML
                    and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content
                    makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.</p>

            <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are
                a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements
                to style. In this article and its sub-articles we'll run through the different types in great detail,
                seeing how they work.

            <p>
                A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of
                elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS
                property values inside the rule applied to them. The element or elements which are selected by the
                selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Types of selectors
            </h3>
            <p>Each CSS rule starts with a selector — or a list of selectors — in order to tell the browser which
                element or elements the rules should apply to. All the examples below are valid selectors or lists of
                selectors There are a few different groupings of selectors, and knowing which type of selector you might
                need will help you to find the right tool for the job. In this article's subarticles we will look at the
                different groups of selectors in more detail.</p>

            </code>
            <p>
                It also includes selectors which target a class:

            </code>
            <p>
                It also includes selectors which target an ID:

        <section id="Attribute_selectors" class="main-section">
            <header>Attribute selectors</header>
            <p>This group of selectors gives you different ways to select elements based on the presence of a certain
                attribute on an element:
            </p>
            <code>
                <span>a[title]{</span><br>

                    <span>}</span>
            </code>
            <p>Or even make a selection based on the presence of an attribute with a particular value:
            </p>
            <code>
                <span>a[href="https://example.com"]{</span> <br>

            <header>Pseudo classes and elements</header>
            <p>This group of selectors includes pseudo-classes, which style certain states of an element. The :hover
                pseudo-class for example selects an element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer:
            </p>
            <code>
                <span> a :hover{</span> <br>

            </code>
            <p>
                It also includes pseudo-elements, which select a certain part of an element rather than the element
                itself. For example, ::first-line always selects the first line of text inside an element (a <<span>
                    p</span>> in the below case), acting as if a <<span></span> span <span>></span> was wrapped around
                        the first formatted line and then selected.
            </p>
            <code>
                <span> p ::first-line{</span> <br>

                The final group of selectors combine other selectors in order to target elements within our documents.
                The following, for example, selects paragraphs that are direct children of <<span>article</span>>
                    elements using the child combinator (>):

            <code>

                Setting CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS language. A property and value
                pair is called a declaration, and any CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single
                element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out, and to style it
            </p>
            <p>The property which is an identifier, that is a human-readable name, that defines which feature is
                considered.</p>

            <p> The basic goal of the Cascading Stylesheet (CSS) language is to allow a browser engine to paint elements
                of the page with specific features, like colors, positioning, or decorations. The value which describe
                how the feature must be handled by the engine. Each property has a set of valid values, defined by a
                formal grammar, as well as a semantic meaning, implemented by the browser engine.
