                The brief history of Gen. Yakubu Gowon's background
            </h2>
            <p class="background">Yakubu 'Jack' Gowon (born 19 October 1934) is a retired Nigerian Army general and
                military
                leader. As Head of
                State of Nigeria, Gowon presided over a controversial Nigerian Civil War and delivered the famous "no
                victor, no vanquished"
                speech at the war's end in an effort to promote healing and reconciliation. The Nigerian Civil War is
                listed
                as one of the
                deadliest in modern history, with some accusing Gowon of crimes against humanity and genocide. Gowon
                maintains that he
                committed no wrongdoing during the war and that his leadership saved the country
            </p>
            <p class="background">
                Gowon is a Ngas (Angas) from Lur, a small village in the present Kanke Local Government Area of Plateau
                State. His parents,
                Nde Yohanna and Matwok Kurnyang left for Wusasa, Zaria as Church Missionary Society (CMS) missionaries
                in
                the early days of Gowon's life.
                His father took pride in the fact that he married the same day as the future Queen Mother Elizabeth
                married
                the future King George VI.
                Gowon was the fifth of eleven children. He grew up in Zaria and had his early life and education there.
                At
                school, Gowon proved to be
                a very good athlete: he was the school football goalkeeper, pole vaulter, and long-distance runner. He
                broke
                the school mile record in
                his first year. He was also the boxing captain
